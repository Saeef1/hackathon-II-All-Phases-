## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the specification creation task. Stage: spec, Title: "backend-task-api-spec", Feature: "task-management".

## Response snapshot

Created a PHR for the backend task API specification creation task, following the template structure with appropriate values for id, title, stage, date, surface, model, feature, branch, user, command, labels, links, files, and tests.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR for tracking spec creation process
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created PHR file at ./history/prompts/task-management/001-backend-task-api-spec.spec.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Will proceed with creating the actual backend task API specification
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR properly documents the initial request for spec creation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with creating the actual spec file
