## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the frontend planning task. Stage: plan, Title: \"frontend-app-api-integration-plan\", Feature: \"frontend-api-integration\".

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created a Prompt History Record for the frontend planning task. The PHR documents the plan stage for integrating the frontend application with the backend API, focusing on how Next.js components will interact with the FastAPI endpoints for the Todo application.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting frontend API integration planning
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created 1 PHR file in history/prompts/frontend-api-integration/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of the frontend components
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper documentation helps track planning decisions

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the frontend components based on this plan
